 *Problem:
•	Suppose you are working for a Toy Company. The company wants you to build software so that they can figure out how to maximize their profits. Each toy has a name, cost, and selling price. 

By completing this activity you will be in the process of solving this problem.

Open the Toy.java. 

1)Write the following  methods in Toy.java:

•	getCost() //returns cost of the object Toy
•	setCost(double newCost)//sets a new cost for the object Toy
•	getSellingPrice()//returns sellingPrice of the object Toy
•	setSellingPrice(double newSellingPrice)//sets a new sellingPrice for the object Toy
•	getProft()//returns the profit for the object Toy

2) In the main method, make 3 different toys objects and output on the console the names of the object from lowest profit to highest profit. 
(save as MainToy.java)



3) What is the difference between a class and an object?

 */
public class Toy {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

}
