 * 4) Create class Square..draw() erase()
 * 5) Create Triangle  Class
 * 	• Try to create the superclass and all its subclasses.
	• For the draw method, use character graphics
	• Identify attributes that would be common to all and organize them into the hierarchy
	• Then create the main method and test the program
